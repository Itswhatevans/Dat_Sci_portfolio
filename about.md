# Hello! I'm Jordan

### Get to Know Me 
Excited to be part of the growing data science and machine learning fields, I combine my technology skills with my interpersonal skills to bring meaningful analyses and insights out of big data. 

Years of experience and training in the field of door-to-door Sales and Network Marketing gave me the skills and attributes necessary to cultivate quality client relations, communicate clearly, and bring optimism and positivity to my workplace. I consistently strive toward self improvement and can apply my intellect and ethic to any task. 
It is said that 90% of workplaces desire sales skills/sales experience, but less than 10% of workers possess those skills.
