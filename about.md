# Hello! I'm Jordan

### Get to Know Me 
Excited to be part of the growing data science and machine learning fields, I combine my technology skills with my interpersonal skills to bring meaningful analyses and insights out of big data. 

Years of experience and training in the field of door-to-door Sales and Network Marketing gave me the skills and attributes necessary to cultivate quality client relations, communicate clearly, and bring optimism and positivity to my workplace. I consistently strive toward self improvement and can apply my intellect and ethic to any task. 
It is said that 90% of workplaces desire sales skills/sales experience, but less than 10% of workers possess those skills.

Statistics major, Data Science Emphasis, Senior, interest in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, creative business solutions. 


### Education

- Brigham Young University

- April, 2026

### Experience
Include relevant experiences such as 
- Jobs

#### Internship:

Assessment Team, Office of Belonging, BYU
- Working in tools like MAXQDA, Excel, Power BI, and R, analyze non-ordinal survey data to extract insight from focus groups and student demographics to improve outreach and further the mission of the office.

#### Major Projects
What affects NBA draft chances? - Group Research Project,	Fall 2024
- _Experimental Design, Data Wrangling, Statistical Modeling_
- Used R (Tidyverse, ggplot2) and NCAA basketball APIs to collect and clean collegiate athlete data
- Built hybrid multiple regression model to identify predictive draft factors; found player position had more impact than traditionally valued statistics (e.g., PPG or RPG)
- Co-led data visualization and storytelling for final team presentation

Do Wash Cycles affect clothing shrinkage? - Group Research Project, Winter 2024
- _Experiment Design, Collection of Data, Statistical Modeling_
- Designed and conducted a controlled experiment with 3 fabric types across different wash cycles
- Analyzed shrinkage patterns using R and Tableau; visualized trends and presented findings in class
- Demonstrated measurable though minor impact of wash cycle settings on shrinkage, even with pre-shrunk fabrics
