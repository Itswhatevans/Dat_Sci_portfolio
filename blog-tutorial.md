# __Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio__
# __Hello! I'm Jordan__ 👋
Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This site shows my journey learning data science and analystics. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered. 

## 🎓 __About This Portfolio__ 
This portfolio shows my work learning data science. Each project includes:
- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I learned and discovered

I built this site using [Quarto]() and host it on [GitHub Pages]()

## 🛠️ __Skills I'm Learning__
- Programming: Python for data analysis and structures, R for statistical data analysis, etc.
- Visualization: Creating charts with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, and Tableau
- Data Collection: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- Analysis: Finding patterns and answering questions with data which I've tidied and wrangled.
